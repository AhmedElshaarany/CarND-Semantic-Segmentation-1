## Project: Semantic Segmentation applied on road dataset

### Introduction
In this project, I implemented a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to label the pixels of a road 

### Results
Here are 2 different images on which the trained FCN has been applied. You can found all the result images in the [runs](https://github.com/Mornor/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation/tree/master/runs/1503860319.698257) folder. <br>

Example 1                                                            | Example 2

### FCN architecture
* Why FCN and not Convolution Network? <br>
I will first explain why I did not choose a simple Convolutional Network here. <br>
A Deep Convolutional Network is really good at guessing what an image is, but we loose the spatial information because of the downsampling made by it. <br> 
Here, as we want to detect the road on an image, it is important to keep this spatial dimension. Hence we use a FCN, which will upsample the output result of VGG16 to its initial size. <br> 

* A FCN is divided into 3 parts: <br>
  * 1. An Encoder, here a pre-trained VGG16 model
  * 2. 1 X 1 Convolution
  * 3. Transposed convolution

### Discussion 
* Choosen parameters (can be tune to yield better results): <br>
  * `5` Epochs
  * A batch size of `8`
  * A dropout of `.75`
  * `AdamOptimizer` with a learning rate of `.0001` 

* `kernel_initializer` <br>
I choose [tf.truncated_normal_initializer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/truncated_normal_initializer) as a way to generate a normal distribution. Though some parameters above have been changed between the two following images, using a 
`kernel_initializer` was a game changer. 

Without kernel_initializer                                           | With kernel_initializer

Talk about parameters to tune, AWS training and kernel_initializer


### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training and test images.
